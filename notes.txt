apache airflow is not built for window so need to install it using docker. it'll download relevent images and run it through containers

1. Install docker and docker-compose (pip/uv install docker and docker-compose)

2.  this is docker-compose.yaml file: curl -LfO 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.10.5/docker-compose.yaml'

    convert it for window by removing -LfO from start and adding -o docker-compose.yaml at the end. then run it in command prompt (curl 'https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/2.10.5/docker-compose.yaml' -o 'docker-compose.yaml')

3.  create these four directories:
    ./dags - you can put your DAG files here.
    ./logs - contains logs from task execution and scheduler.
    ./config - you can add custom log parser or add airflow_local_settings.py to configure cluster policy.
    ./plugins - you can put your custom plugins here.


4. For other operating systems, It may give a warning that AIRFLOW_UID is not set. so, manually create an .env file in the same folder as docker-compose.yaml with this content to get rid of the warning:

    paste it inside the file: AIRFLOW_UID=50000

5. Initialize the database
On all operating systems, you need to run database migrations and create the first user account. To do this, run.

    >> for older version of docker run this: docker-compose up airflow-init
                            or
    >> for new version of docker run this: docker compose up airflow-init

    >> After initialization is complete, you should see a message like this:

    airflow-init_1       | Upgrades done
    airflow-init_1       | Admin user airflow created
    airflow-init_1       | 2.10.5
    start_airflow-init_1 exited with code 0

>> Now you can start all services:
docker-compose up
        or
docker-compose up -d

The account created has the login airflow and the password airflow.


6. To delete inbuilt dags
docker-compose down
        or
docker-compose down -v
